# portuguese-simplification
## Installing
### 1. Create a fresh environment

I will be using conda but you can use your choice of environment management tool.

```
conda create -n acl24 python==3.10
```

### 2. Install PyTorch 2.1 (nightly)


```
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu118
```

This will download CUDA driver version 11.8 if it is compatible with your installed CUDA runtime version.

### 3. Install other libraries

Let's install other requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt tokenizers sentencepiece huggingface_hub wandb>=0.12.10
```


## How to use

### Mined data
Portuguese paraphrase pairs and contexts that were mined from the common crawl data are located in the data/ccnet/ folder. These data are necessary for the training.

### Train the model
After adjusting the hyperparameters in the file scripts/train.py, run the command. 
```python
python scripts/train.py 
```
Please disregard the variable features_kwargs in the train.py file.

### Evaluate a trained model
After setting the variables model_version and model_paths in the file scripts/eval_models.py, run the command below. The default test set is porsimplessent. To change this behaviour, one must change the source/utils.py file.
```python
python scripts/eval_models.py 
```

    abstract = "Automatic text simplification focuses on transforming texts into a more comprehensible version without sacrificing their precision. However, automatic methods usually require (paired) datasets that can be rather scarce in languages other than English. This paper presents a new approach to automatic sentence simplification that leverages paraphrases, context, and linguistic attributes to overcome the absence of paired texts in Portuguese.We frame the simplification problem as a textual style transfer task and learn a style representation using the sentences around the target sentence in the document and its linguistic attributes. Moreover, unlike most unsupervised approaches that require style-labeled training data, we fine-tune strong pre-trained models using sentence-level paraphrases instead of annotated data. Our experiments show that our model achieves remarkable results, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (BART+ACCESS) while competitively matching a Large Language Model.",
